# JavaScript Review

This repository is dedicated to reviewing the **JavaScript** language.  
I already have experience with JavaScript, but since I haven’t worked with it for a while, this project serves as a complete refresher.

Each folder or section represents a specific topic that I’m currently revisiting or practicing to strengthen my understanding of the language.
